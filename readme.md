# addon-mqtt-server-mosquitto

> OHX is a modern smarthome solution, embracing technologies like software containers for language agnostic extensibility. Written in Rust with an extensive test suite, OHX is fast, efficient, secure and fun to work on.

This is an OHX Addon. It provides the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT Server with auth plugin for OHX.

* Install this Addon to your local OHX installation via the [OHX CLI](#cli): `ohx-cli addon install addon-mqtt-server-mosquitto`.
* The maintainer can deploy a new version (after updating `addon.yml`) with `ohx-addon-cli deploy`.
